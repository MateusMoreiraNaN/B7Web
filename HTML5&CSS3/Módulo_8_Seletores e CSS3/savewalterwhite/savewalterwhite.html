                My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I
                <br>
                found out he was going to die.  That it was going to happen
                <br>
                Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.  I guess I kind
                <br>
                of took him for granted or something.  I mean, our parents are
                <br>
                just always there.  You expect them to always be bugging you
                <br>
                to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or
                <br>
                try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one
                <br>
                day.  And make you get up early on the weekend to have
                <br>
                "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me
                <br>
                crazy.  I don't feel that way now.  Everything's different since
                <br>
                Dad got his diagnosis.  Since I realized that one day in the
                <br>
                near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.

            <p class="small-copy yellow justify">
                Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that
                <br>
                question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-
                <br>
                sible. One day he won't be here to ask.Now I feel lucky when I hear
                <br>
                his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-
                <br>
                ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.

                My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.
                <br>
                I mean, super brainiac annoying.  He knows the most random stuff.  Like
                <br>
                how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.
                <br>
                And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it
                <br>
                takes up about 9% more space.  Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt
                <br>
                into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level
                <br>
                will go down.  He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He
                <br>
                doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.
                <br>
                I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is.  He likes to cook
                <br>
                because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-
                <br>
                cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he
                <br>
                goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.
                <br>
                He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.
